## ðŸ¤© Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node >= 18.x.x

  Use any of the following to manage different node versions on you machine:

  - [Volta](https://volta.sh/)
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

- **Optional** - [Nx Cli](https://nx.dev/l/a/getting-started/nx-cli)

  ```bash
  npm i -g @nrwl/cli
  ```

### Running an application locally

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

1. Start the application you're interested in by running

   ```bash
   // If you installed the Nx cli
   nx serve <application-name>

   // Use package.json scripts
   npm run start properties

   // Otherwise
   npx run nx serve <application-name>
   ```

   > **NOTE**: The application name is the name of the directory in the **apps** directory at the root of the repository.

1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4200/<application baseUrl>`

   See the **next.config.ts** file within the application your running to identify the baseUrl

## Deployment

Amplify follows a [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) approach to development. To configure Amplify to work with Nx, You first need to create the Amplify applications & tell amplify how to build your NextJs applications. Luckily you can do with using the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

The CDK script can be found in the `build` directory at the root of this repo. Once you've deployed the CDK script any subsequent merges into your specified branch (in this case `aws-amplify-cdk`) will trigger a deployment.

1. Deploy CDK

   `npm run cdk:bootstrap && npm run cdk:deploy`

2. Merge change to your target branch

   `git push origin aws-amplify-cdk`

3. Destroy applications

   `npm run cdk:destroy`

Once both applications were deployed a Cloudfront distribution was created to combine the 2 applications under a single domain.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

- Fully managed hosted environment

### Cons

- Can't configure trunk based development.
